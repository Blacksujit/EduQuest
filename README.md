## Introduction

The **Gamified Learning Management System (LMS)** is designed to enhance traditional learning experiences by integrating gamification elements, such as badges, achievements, and leaderboards. This system aims to increase student engagement and improve learning outcomes through motivation and interactive learning environments.

## Problem Statement

Traditional learning platforms often fail to keep students engaged, leading to decreased participation and lower learning outcomes. Our goal is to create a **Gamified LMS** that motivates students by introducing game-like elements into their educational journey.

## What We Expect

We aim to develop an **engaging LMS** that promotes active participation through gamification techniques. By rewarding achievements, tracking progress, and providing an interactive learning environment, this platform helps students stay motivated and committed to their educational goals.

## Solution Guidelines

The LMS will include the following key features:
- **Achievements and Badges**: Students will earn badges for completing milestones, such as finishing a course or scoring well on quizzes.
- **Leaderboards**: Students can compete with their peers by earning points and climbing the leaderboard, creating healthy competition.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback on course progress allows students to track their journey and stay on course.
- **Interactive Courses**: Teachers and admins can create quizzes, lessons, and modules with real-time feedback, which helps students adjust their learning strategies.
